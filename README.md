# Odin Recipes Project

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum. The goal is to build a recipe application that allows users to practice key skills such as:

- HTML & CSS layout
- JavaScript DOM manipulation
- Working with Git and GitHub
- Project organization and file structure

By completing this project, I will have demonstrated my ability to create a functional web application, use version control effectively, and apply front-end development skills in a real-world scenario.
